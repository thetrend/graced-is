So I made pot brownies! It was a week and a half ago so they are completely demolished at this point but I wanted to document this for future reference.

I started out with 22.5mg of trim at what we assume is 15% THC. We don't have a tester (yet) but I think it's a good bet. Anyway, I steeped the trim in coconut oil like it was tea for _three hours_ (painful but worth it) then I made the brownies which are a variant of _Scientifically Sweet's_ [Double Chocolate Brownies](https://scientificallysweet.com/double-chocolate-brownies/). I used Lindt Dark Chocolate with whole hazelnuts for the brownie chocolate as well as put a quarter in the hazelnut spread (Bonne Maman) then the last quarter as the topper. The only thing I forgot to write down was the time and temperature since I kind of fucked it up at first. It should be 350Â°F for 20 minutes _I think_ so just watch your oven and test, test, test.

Pan was 7x11 Pyrex. Made about 24 very tiny but _very potent_ brownies.

The final result:

![Triple Hazelnut Pot Brownies](/static/2025/05/pot-brownies/brownies.jpeg)

Recipe:
- 5 oz. dark chocolate, coarsely chopped
- 6 tbs. infused coconut oil
- 2 large eggs (room temp)
- 1 c. granulated sugar
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1/2 c. all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp. salt

Hazelnut spread:
- 12 oz. hazelnut spread
- 2 tsp. infused coconut oil
- 5 oz. dark chocolate, finely chopped

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°. Spray your pan with Pam or butter then flour (or use cocoa powder) to prevent the brownies from sticking.
2. Double-boil coarsely chopped chocolate and coconut oil until completely melted. Let cool 5 min.
3. Beat eggs with sugar in large bowl using whisk until pale, thick, and fluffy.
4. Beat in vanilla then stir in warm chocolate mixture until evenly blended.
5. Stir in flour until well incorporated and smooth.
6. Pour batter into prepared pan and use spatula to even out the surface.
7. Bake until slightly puffed. Toothpick inserted should have a few moist crumbs. Let cool completely.

Spread:
Mix hazelnut spread, coconut oil, and dark chocolate. Chill before spreading.

Combine:
Once the brownies are cool, spread the hazelnut spread mixture over the top and add remaining hazelnut/chocolate crumbs leftover.

**MAKE SURE TO PRECUT YOUR BROWNIES!**

And don't eat 4 of them in a day like I did. ðŸ˜‰
