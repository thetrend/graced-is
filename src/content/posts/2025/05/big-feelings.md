Listening to AJR right now, specifically "God is Really Real" (I'm not suddenly a believer-- the lyrics are really freaking sad) and I am having _BIG FEELINGS_. Grief is a moving target some days. Today is one of those days.

I miss my mom. I miss my dad. I miss my beloved cat.

May is always really weird and hard, sometimes there are good memories but mostly just bad ones. I've been trying to not make it a big deal this year but as the book says, _"The body keeps the score"_.

I don't know what June will look like. Mom's birthday is in June. This is the first birthday since her death and I truthfully don't know how I'm going to react. And Father's Day is in June too, but I'm just going to preoccupy myself by wishing my father-in-law a good day. Four years since my dad's been laid to rest. Fuck.

I was an utter mess last year (understatement of the century) because I had weaned off of my medication and weaning off didn't work. Long story short, it was a really bad idea no matter how well monitored I was, because I couldn't deal with life at the time. I'm better now, much better this year. On the anniversary of last year's incident I was agitated and stuck in migraine land for a couple days, but that was the most of it.

I'm in a really good place this year, hands down all 10s across the board. Work is going amazingly well, and since that's the vast majority of my week, I'd say that's a notable achievement. I have a rotating array of hobbies that I'm really enjoying for once. Just tonight I finally cracked the code on enjoying creating art without torturing myself for perfection's sake. It's taken me 33 fucking years to get here, but I'm finally here.

Do I feel guilty? No. Grief is just a really heavy burden.

We went to one of my favorite cafes today for brunch. Literally had a fancy version of McD's Big Breakfast. It was great. Then we went shopping @ The Shoppes at Farmington Valley and hubby bought me some adorable outfits that I can't wait to wear. We went to Lowe's for his plants then had lunch and I bought some painting ebooks. Today was a good day.

I just feel really fucking sad.

My mom moved away several years ago and I never saw her again aside from the occasional Facebook video call. Then she passed last year around the holidays and god, that hit me like a ton of bricks. The biggest pain that I carry with me is that my last call with her was the day before Halloween when she said she'd see me in heaven. I couldn't bring myself to call her again after that because... well, there's no good reason. I just... couldn't. Finally I called in December, coincidentally on the day she died. She had just passed and I just barely missed her. I try to tell myself that she said her goodbyes any time I get lost in my thoughts. It doesn't make it any easier.

I didn't really visit my parents after I left home, but I did visit more often when my dad's disease got worse. 

_The Earth is spinning like it always did_
_The New York Times is publishing_
_Some real important thing_
_And each day when the world wakes up_
_Our lawns will still be wet_
_And my dad can't get out of bed_

I believe the opposite of what a lot of people believe when they say people come into your life for a reason. Ever since my parents passed I have learned the one truth that is real for every person on this planet: your time with a person is finite and it will come to an end one day. That gives me peace.

But for tonight I will continue sobbing while I listen to this album.
