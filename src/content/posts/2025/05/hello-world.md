Well, I have been terrible at documenting my life as of late. This is my latest attempt. Hopefully this will be permanent. ðŸ™‚ I want this to be a space where I throw all my markdown diaries and tutorials, whether that's code or trying out different recipes for weed brownies. (Relax, it's legal in my state!) I also want to post my own informal reviews of media but we'll see if I ever get around to doing that.

We (hubby and I) went to NYC back on April 19 and life has been a whirlwind since then. We met up with an old friend from high school which was honestly so needed. I've run away for so long from my past that being (gently) confronted by a person from that past was a real eye-opener. 

Hubs and I checked out The Flowery Upper West Side and the vibe was so cool. I took a photo of the gorgeous flowers blooming outside after we got done.

The most exciting thing from that day aside from seeing my friend after almost **fifteen** years was taking her to The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) ðŸ’–. We spent a good handful of hours there and watched _The Clock_ again before they end the exhibit this month. Got to share my love of modern art with my friend and revisit one of my favorite pieces below.

It was a fun day of subway traipsing and it was beautiful weather too! We went to Junior's Cheesecake and Chinatown (first time for us) plus had some killer Chinese (because obv). We wound down with a trip to Central Park where my friend really opened my eyes to who I've been since I left home. Finally we took her back to her train station before we almost missed the last train home ðŸ˜… but we made it! It was a late night but SO well worth it. Already hoping to visit NYC again with our friend.

Immediately after that day I had a week of wisdom tooth bs (my last one finally). Got it removed and dealt with the antibiotics and aftercare of that. Promptly found out that I have severe sleeping issues thanks to genetics ðŸ™ƒ.

In between wisdom tooth fun and confirming yesterday that I need some serious dental work done (I have a tongue tie apparently), we also had to take Katie Cat to the vet. Glad she's OK but also glad I got a raise so we could afford the $200+ vet bill. She's doing ok, just grumpy and hot since it's starting to warm up here in CT.

I also made [pot brownies](/posts/2025/05/pot-brownies)! It was a bit of an ordeal but I'll have a separate post about that later.

Mother's Day came and went. I tried to keep busy and had an extended weekend thanks to some back to back doctors' appointments on Monday and Tuesday. My joke is that I'll never have to make a phone call on Mother's Day ever again. Bad form, yes, but funny nonetheless. I have the best friends by the way-- a dear friend texted me that day to check in on me. I am so loved.

We also went to a local park a few times between last week and Monday! I've never been a nature girly but ever since moving up here I can't help but admire the beauty and simplicity but also complexity of nature.

Currently obsessed with the soundtrack to _Death Becomes Her_ on Spotify. I love Broadway so much.
